# CS230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room, developers of Draw It or Lose It, would like to develop a web-based version of their game. Currently, Draw It or Lose It is only available for Android devices. By creating a web-based version of the game The Gaming Room hopes to serve multiple platforms.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I was able to convey my findings in simple language and an organized manner.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Having access to the information in the design document gave me a clear understanding of the client's requirements and goals. This meant I was able to develop code in line with their requirements instead of writing code that would need to be changed later to meet their needs.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would add to the recommendation section the suggestion to use cloud memory.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It was important to consider that the end user could be on a variety of devices and connections accessing the game. It was valuable to consider mobile connection speeds, storage, and memory use when making suggestions related to handling storage and memory from the server side. Additionally, the client's goal is to reach a wider audience which, if successful, means accounting for an increase in traffic requiring scalability. If these needs were not considered, the game would not run efficiently resulting in an unsatisfactory user experience.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I took my time to review the clients wants and goals and to consider how the design of the software could either help or hinder achieving those goals. I was able to research different approaches and found best practices for similar applications. Once I understood the different roles of the elements in these systems and the intended use of the software, I was able to suggest a “best fit” for the project. In the future, I plan to take a similar approach and will consider new information and technologies that become available.
